 <h1>My Favorite Superheros: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
 <h2>DC Heroes </h2>
 <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
   The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Wolverine</strong>.</p>

 <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever.</small></h3>
 <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industries, wheres DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industries are more mediocre</P>
 <h4>Conclusion</h4>
 <p><blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote> But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whateve that's its worth.<p>
